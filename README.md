Required: 

Extend your service functionality by:  

adding basic validation to DTO classes 

using mapstruct to map DTOs 

implementing custom common and unified error handling functionality using Spring MVC components 

adding the Spring Boot Actuator to your project and configuring the ‘/info’ endpoint of it. 

extending your service RESTful endpoints by Swagger Documentation    

create custom validation annotations using ConstraintValidator 

Optional (would be a great plus):

Investigate add multilingual support for exception messages configuring the ‘MessageSource’ bean - https://www.baeldung.com/spring-custom-validation-message-source
